/**
 * Factory Method Design Pattern
 *
 * Intent: Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but
 * allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
 *
 * Example: In this example, the Factory Method pattern provides an interface
 * for creating social network connectors, which can be used to log in to the
 * network, create posts and potentially perform other activitiesâ€”and all of
 * this without coupling the client code to specific classes of the particular
 * social network.

 * - Before: $p = new FacebookConnector;
 * - After: $p = $this->getSocialNetwork;
 *
 * This allows changing the type of the product being created by
